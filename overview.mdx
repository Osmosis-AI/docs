The Osmosis API helps you build smarter, more context-aware AI agents. Our API provides essential building blocks for creating agents that learn from past interactions and make better decisions over time.

## Why Use Osmosis?

AI agent builders often face the challenge of continually adding more edge case handling prompts to their agents.

However, with Osmosis, you can now attach these edge cases directly to the input prompt while keeping the system prompt clean. This is achieved using the [enhance_task](/api-reference/enhance-task) endpoint, which attaches edge cases learned from past interactions that are stored through the [store_knowledge](/api-reference/store-knowledge) endpoint.

Here's how Osmosis helps:
