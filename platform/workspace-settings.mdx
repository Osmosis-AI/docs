Workspace settings control access, integrations, and configuration for your Osmosis team.

## Workspace Management

From **Settings → Workspace → General**:

- **Name** — Display name for your workspace
- **Description** — Brief description of what your team works on
- **Workspace ID** — Unique identifier used in API calls

## Team Members

Manage who has access to your workspace from **Settings → Workspace → Team**.

### Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Owner** | Full access. Manage billing, delete workspace, manage all settings. |
| **Admin** | Manage members, create projects, configure integrations. Cannot delete workspace or manage billing. |
| **Member** | Create and run training runs, view metrics, access projects. Cannot manage workspace settings. |

### Inviting Members

1. Go to **Settings → Workspace → Team**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter their email address and select a role
4. They'll receive an email invitation to join the workspace

## API Keys

Generate API keys for programmatic access to the Osmosis platform.

From **Settings → Workspace → API Keys**:

- **Create** new API keys with optional descriptions
- **View** active keys (only the prefix is shown after creation)
- **Revoke** keys that are no longer needed

<Warning>
API keys grant full access to your workspace. Store them securely and never commit them to version control.
</Warning>

### Using API Keys

Set the API key as an environment variable for SDK and CLI usage:

```bash
export OSMOSIS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Or authenticate via the CLI:

```bash
osmosis login
```

## CLI Tokens

The `osmosis login` command stores a CLI token locally for authentication. Tokens are scoped to your user account and workspace.

To manage CLI sessions:

```bash
# Authenticate
osmosis login

# Check current authentication status
osmosis whoami
```

## Hugging Face Integration

Connect your Hugging Face account to export trained models directly from the platform.

From **Settings → Workspace → Integrations**:

1. Click **Connect Hugging Face**
2. Authorize Osmosis to access your Hugging Face account
3. Once connected, you can upload merged checkpoints to any of your Hugging Face repositories

See [Monitoring → Exporting to Hugging Face](/platform/monitoring#exporting-to-hugging-face) for export details.

## LLM Provider Keys

Configure API keys for LLM providers used by [reward rubrics](/platform/llm-judges) during training.

From **Settings → Workspace → LLM Providers**:

- Add keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, and other supported providers
- Keys are encrypted at rest and only used during training runs
- Test provider connectivity from the settings page

## Billing

From **Settings → Workspace → Billing** (Owner only):

- View current usage and costs
- Manage payment methods
- View billing history
