This guide walks you through setting up the Osmosis Platform from scratch.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Go to [platform.osmosis.ai](https://platform.osmosis.ai) and sign up
2. Create a new workspace (or join an existing one via team invite)
3. You'll land on the workspace dashboard

## Step 2: Install the SDK

Install the Osmosis Python SDK and authenticate:

```bash
pip install osmosis-ai
osmosis login
```

The `osmosis login` command opens your browser to authenticate with the platform and stores your CLI token locally.

## Step 3: Create a Project

From your workspace dashboard:

1. Click **New Project**
2. Give it a name and description
3. Choose your workflow — this determines how you'll connect your code:
   - **Git Sync**: Connect a GitHub repository with reward functions and tools
   - **Remote Rollout**: Point to a rollout server you host

## Step 4: Choose Your Path

    **Sync tools and rewards from GitHub**

    1. Structure your repository with `mcp/`, `reward_fn/`, `reward_rubric/` folders
    2. Install the [GitHub App](/platform/github-integration) and connect your repo
    3. Push code — Osmosis auto-syncs your components
    4. Configure a [training run](/platform/training-runs) using your synced components

  <Card title="Remote Rollout Path" icon="server" href="/remote-rollout/quickstart">
    **Build and host a custom agent server**

    1. Implement a `RolloutAgentLoop` using the SDK
    2. Test locally with `osmosis test`
    3. Deploy your server and register the URL on the platform
    4. Configure a [training run](/platform/training-runs) pointing to your server
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 5: Configure Training

Once your code is connected (via Git Sync or Remote Rollout):

1. Navigate to **Training Runs** in your project
2. Click **New Training Run**
3. Select your base model, dataset, reward functions, and tools
4. Configure hyperparameters (or use defaults)
5. Click **Start Training**

See [Training Runs](/platform/training-runs) for detailed configuration options.

## Step 6: Monitor and Export

While training runs:

- Watch real-time metrics on the [Monitoring](/platform/monitoring) dashboard
- Review training logs and checkpoints
- When satisfied, merge a checkpoint and export to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)
