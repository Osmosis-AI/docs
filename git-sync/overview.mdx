description: 'Sync your GitHub repository with Osmosis AI platform'
---

The Osmosis AI platform supports automatic synchronization from GitHub repositories. You can store your MCP tools, reward functions, and reward rubrics in your own repository (public or private), and Osmosis will automatically discover and sync them.

<Tip>
To connect your repository, install the Osmosis GitHub App from the platform. See [GitHub Integration](/platform/github-integration) for setup instructions.
</Tip>

## Why Use Git Sync?

By connecting your GitHub repository to Osmosis, you can:
- **Version control** your evaluation logic alongside your application code
- **Collaborate** with your team using familiar Git workflows
- **Automate** deployments through CI/CD pipelines
- **Keep repositories private** while still syncing with Osmosis

## What Can You Sync?

Osmosis automatically discovers and syncs three types of components from your repository:

1. **MCP Tools** - Extend AI agent capabilities with custom functions
2. **Reward Functions** - Provide deterministic, numeric scoring for LLM outputs
3. **Reward Rubrics** - Use LLMs to evaluate outputs with natural language criteria

## Example Repository

Check out our reference implementation: [osmosis-git-sync-example](https://github.com/Osmosis-AI/osmosis-git-sync-example)

This example demonstrates the complete folder structure and code artifacts that the Osmosis GitHub integration discovers and syncs.

## How It Works

1. **Structure** your repository with the required folders
2. **Implement** your functions using the Osmosis AI decorators
3. **Push** to GitHub (public or private)
4. **Connect** your repository to the Osmosis platform
5. **Sync** automatically - Osmosis discovers and deploys your components

## When to Use Git Sync

Choose Git Sync when you want to:
- **Version control** evaluation logic alongside application code
- **Collaborate** with your team using Git workflows
- **Deploy** automatically through CI/CD
- **Keep code private** while using the Osmosis platform
- **Manage** multiple rubrics and functions in one place

For quick local testing and development, use the [Python SDK](/python-sdk/introduction) directly instead.
