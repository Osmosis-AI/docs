<Warning>
**Required `**kwargs` Parameter**

All reward functions and rubrics **must** include `**kwargs` in their signature for compatibility with the Osmosis platform. The platform may pass additional parameters in future versions, and omitting `**kwargs` will cause errors.

```python
# Correct - includes **kwargs
def my_function(solution_str: str, ground_truth: str | None, extra_info: dict, **kwargs) -> float:
    pass

# Wrong - missing **kwargs
def my_function(solution_str: str, ground_truth: str | None, extra_info: dict) -> float:
    pass
```
</Warning>
