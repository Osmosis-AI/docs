title: 'Osmosis - Self-Improving AI Through Reinforcement Learning'
description: 'Train smarter AI agents with reinforcement learning on your own tools and data'
---

Osmosis is a platform for training LLMs through reinforcement learning with custom tools and evaluation logic. You define how your agent should behave — the tools it can use, how its outputs are scored, and what data it trains on — and Osmosis handles the GPU infrastructure, training loops, and model management.

The result: models that get measurably better at your specific tasks over time, without manual fine-tuning.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[You Define] --> B[Osmosis Platform]
    B --> C[Trained Model]

    subgraph A[You Define]
        direction TB
        A1[Tools & Agent Logic]
        A2[Reward Functions]
        A3[Training Data]
    end

    subgraph B[Osmosis Platform]
        direction TB
        B1[GPU Training Cluster]
        B2[RL Training Loop]
        B3[Checkpoints & Metrics]
    end

    subgraph C[Trained Model]
        direction TB
        C1[Merge to HuggingFace]
        C2[Deploy Anywhere]
    end
```

## Choose Your Workflow

Osmosis supports two main workflows for connecting your code to the training platform:

| | Git Sync | Remote Rollout |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Reward functions, rubrics, MCP tools | Custom agent loops with complex logic |
| **How it works** | Push to GitHub → auto-synced to platform | Run your own HTTP server → platform connects |
| **Setup** | Add decorators + folder structure | Implement `RolloutAgentLoop` |
| **When to use** | Standard tool-use training | Multi-step reasoning, custom environments |
