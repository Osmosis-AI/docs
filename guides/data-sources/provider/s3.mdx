## Connect Amazon S3

Bring your AWS S3 data into Osmosis in just a few easy steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Gather S3 Bucket Details">
    Start by creating a new Amazon S3 bucket or choosing an existing one.

    <Note>
      Make a note of your **Bucket Name**, **AWS Region**, and the **File Path** to the data you want to access.
    </Note>

    - **Manage Buckets**: [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)
    - **Learn More**: [Official AWS S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html)
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Set Up IAM Permissions">
    Attach this policy to your IAM user or role to enable Osmosis access. This policy allows Osmosis to list the bucket contents and retrieve objects.

    - **Manage IAM Users**: [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users)

    ```json IAM Policy Example
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:ListBucket"
          ],
          "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>",
            "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/<your-path>/*"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    <Tip>
      Replace `<your-bucket-name>` and `<your-path>` with your actual bucket and file path details. If your files are located at the root of the bucket, use `/*` instead of `<your-path>/*` in the second resource.
    </Tip>
    <Info>
      For optimal security, ensure your IAM permissions are precisely scoped to only the resources Osmosis needs to access.
    </Info> 
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Obtain AWS Credentials">
    You will need an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** from an IAM user with the required S3 policy attached.
    
    You can generate these credentials in the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users).
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Configure S3 in Osmosis">
    Finally, enter the collected details into the Osmosis [new data source form](https://platform.osmosis.ai/data-sources/new):

    - **Bucket Name**
    - **AWS Region**
    - **File Path**
    - **AWS Access Key ID**
    - **AWS Secret Access Key**
    
    Once entered, click **Connect Data Source** to verify your credentials and bucket accessibility.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting: Access Denied Errors">
<Warning>
If you encounter an <strong>Access denied to S3 resource</strong> error when connecting your S3 bucket, double-check the following:
</Warning>

- **Bucket Region**: Ensure the AWS region you entered matches the region where your S3 bucket is deployed.
- **IAM Permissions**: Confirm your IAM user or role has the correct policy attached, with all required S3 actions and the correct bucket ARN(s).
- **Bucket Name**: Verify that the bucket name is spelled correctly and matches exactly (including case sensitivity).
- **File Path**: Make sure the file path in your policy matches the location of your data in the bucket.
- **Credentials**: Ensure you are using the correct Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for the IAM user with the attached policy.
