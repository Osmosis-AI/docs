# Connect AWS Kinesis

Seamlessly stream real-time AWS Kinesis data into Osmosis.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Gather Kinesis Stream Details">
    To begin, you need to either create a new Kinesis data stream or select an existing one in your AWS account.

    <Note>
      Make a note of your **Kinesis Stream Name** and **AWS Region**.
    </Note>

    - **Manage Streams**: [AWS Kinesis Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/home)
    - **Learn More**: [Official AWS Kinesis Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html)
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Set Up IAM Permissions">
    Attach the following policy to your IAM user or role to grant Osmosis the necessary permissions to read from your stream.

    - **Manage IAM Users**: [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users)

    ```json IAM Policy Example
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "kinesis:GetRecords",
            "kinesis:GetShardIterator",
            "kinesis:DescribeStream",
            "kinesis:ListStreams"
          ],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:kinesis:<region>:<account-id>:stream/<your-stream-name>"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    <Tip>
      Replace `<region>`, `<account-id>`, and `<your-stream-name>` with your actual stream ARN. You can find it in the Kinesis Console "Data stream summary" section.
    </Tip>
    <Info>
      For optimal security, ensure your IAM permissions are precisely scoped to only the resources Osmosis needs to access.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Obtain AWS Credentials">
    You will need an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** from an IAM user with the policy attached.
    
    You can generate these credentials in the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users).
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Configure Kinesis in Osmosis">
    Finally, enter the collected details into the Osmosis new data source form:

    - **AWS Region**
    - **Kinesis Stream Name**
    - **AWS Access Key ID**
    - **AWS Secret Access Key**
    
    Once entered, click **Connect Data Source** to verify that everything is configured correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting: Access Denied Errors">
<Warning>
If you encounter an <strong>Access denied to Kinesis resource</strong> error when connecting your Kinesis stream, double-check the following:
</Warning>

- **Stream Region**: Ensure the AWS region you entered matches the region where your Kinesis stream is deployed.
- **IAM Permissions**: Confirm your IAM user or role has the correct policy attached, with all required Kinesis actions and the correct stream ARN.
- **Stream Name**: Verify that the stream name is spelled correctly and matches exactly (including case sensitivity).
- **Credentials**: Make sure you are using the correct Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for the IAM user with the attached policy.
